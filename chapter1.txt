Long long time ago their lived an age of despair and anxiety.

But One day a great Sage appear. The fantastic, still looking man, who was beyond the compulsions of life. 

The sage sat for days and years. No one can account it for certain. People gathered arround him. Many came, many went, untill only seven left. These 7 sages would further create history, by bringing the world towards its dawn of awareness.
